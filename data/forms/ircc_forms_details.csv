Eligibility
Question 9.
Physical Presence and the five (5) year eligibility period
The eligibility period is five (5) years before the date you sign your application. The minimum amount of time you need to be physically present in Canada is 1095 days within the five years immediately before applying.
We encourage applicants to apply with more than the minimum requirement of 1095 days of physical presence, to account for any miscalculations of absences, or any other aspect that could lower the physical presence total below 1095 days.
You must complete and submit the printout of your Online Physical Presence Calculation. If you have not already completed this step please do so by visiting the Online Physical Presence Calculator.
Note: We strongly encourage you to use the online calculator as it is the most accurate way to check your eligibility. If you are unable to use the Online Physical Presence Calculator, you may complete the How to Calculate Physical Presence (CIT 0407) (opens in new tab) .
You don’t have to sign or date your physical presence calculation (your printout of the Online Physical Presence Calculator or form CIT 0407).
You may be able to use some of your time spent in Canada as an authorized temporary resident or protected person towards your physical presence calculation. Each day spent physically in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person before becoming a permanent resident within the last five (5) years, will count as one half day, with a maximum of 365 days towards your physical presence.
Temporary resident status includes lawful authorization to enter or remain in Canada as a:
visitor,
student,
worker or,
temporary resident permit holder
Note: If you were issued work or study permits while your refugee claim and/or Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) was being assessed, these documents did not grant you temporary resident status. You can’t claim temporary resident time for those periods.
A protected person is someone who:
was found to be in need of protection or a convention refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board
or
received a positive decision on a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.
If you are claiming time as a Protected Person, the only time allowed is the time from when you received a positive Protected Person decision on your refugee claim or PRRA application until the day before you became a Permanent Resident.
Enter the “To” date from your physical presence calculator. This date is the last day in your eligibility period which is found on the physical presence summary or printout.
There are very rare situations that will allow you to count time outside of Canada towards your physical presence calculation. If you resided outside of Canada because either:
you; and/or
your Canadian citizen or permanent resident spouse or common law partner; or
your permanent resident parent
were employed outside Canada (not as a locally engaged person) in or with:
the Canadian Armed Forces
the federal public administration
the public service of a province or territory
Select yes, complete the Residence Outside Canada (CIT 0177) (opens in new tab)  and submit any supporting documents requested in that form with your application.
If you have no time to count, select no and continue to the next question without filling out the form CIT0177.
Question 10.

You don’t need to include addresses of family, friends, hotels or resorts where you stayed while on vacation.
Provide information that covers the 5-year eligibility period. Do not leave any gaps during this period and do not leave this section blank. If you do, your application will be returned to you as incomplete.
Note: Your current address history row 1 will auto-populate from your contact information. If you change your address in row 1, it will change your contact information. Additionally, if you lived at your current address for more than 5 years, then you only need to update the date in row 1 that was auto-populated from your connection information.
Police certificate(s)
You need to provide a police certificate from each country, other than Canada, if you were there
in the past 4 years
for 183 days or more in a row
since the age of 18
Indicate in the chart the name of each country and provide a police certificate.
You don’t need to provide a police certificate if
you were in your country of origin immediately prior to becoming a permanent resident and landing in Canada, and
this time falls within the past 4 years
If you can’t get a police certificate, tell us why in the explanation box.
To be valid, the police certificate must be either issued

The UCI and the date your citizenship was granted will only be used by Elections Canada for administrative purposes, and will not be shared by Elections Canada except as required by law.
If you check “Yes”, IRCC will provide your name, residential and mailing address, gender, date of birth, UCI and the date your citizenship was granted to Elections Canada in order to add you to the Register, but only after you become a Canadian citizen. If you check No, IRCC will not provide your information to Elections Canada. You will still have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums, but you will have to take the necessary steps to be added to the list.
More information about the Register and its uses is available on their website. You can also call Elections Canada at 1-800-463-6868.
Chief Electoral officer of Québec, if you live in Québec
If you are 18 years or older and reside in Québec, indicate whether you authorize IRCC to provide to the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec the following information so that your name can be added to the Permanent List of Electors (voters) if you became a Canadian citizen:
your name
your residential address, and the date when you started to reside at that address
your gender
your date of birth
your Unique Client Identifier (UCI), and
the date you were granted citizenship
Your application for citizenship will in no way be affected by your answer to this question.
The Election Act allows the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec to:
provide voter information to provincial political parties and members of the National Assembly as well as municipal and school boards to compile and update lists of electors (voters) lists for municipal and school elections, and
notify the elector in writing that their name has been entered on the permanent list of electors, requesting that the elector correct or complete the information which concerns them, where required.
The Chief Electoral Officer of Québec receives the UCI for administrative purposes only, while the date your citizenship was granted allows them to validate that you qualify as an elector based on the electoral laws it administers. This information is subject to no other use or communication.
If you do not provide authorization, you will still be able to vote, but you will have to visit the revision office and present two supporting documents to register. Once your name is registered on the list of electors you will be able to vote in a provincial, municipal or school election.

Appointment of a representative
Question 9
Tell us if someone helped you complete your application package using the drop down
menu
If you are appointing an individual, firm or organization as your representative, you
must complete the Use of a Representative Form (IMM 5476) (opens in new tab)  and include it
when you send us your application. Once you appoint a representative, all
correspondence from us about your application will be sent to the representative and
not to you.
Eligibility
Question 10
Physical Presence and the five (5) year eligibility period
The eligibility period is five (5) years before the date you sign your application.
The minimum amount of time you need to be physically present in Canada is 1095 days
within the five years immediately before applying.
We encourage applicants to apply with more than the minimum requirement of 1095 days of physical presence, to account for any miscalculations of absences, or any other aspect that could lower the physical presence total below 1095 days.
Note: Is the minor applying too early? If the minor applies
before they meet the physical presence requirements, they will not qualify for
citizenship. The application will be returned and the minor will have to
re-apply later.
You must complete and submit the printout of your Online Physical Presence
Calculation. If you have not already completed this step please do so by visiting
the Online
Physical Presence Calculator.
Note: We strongly encourage you to use the online calculator as
it is the most accurate way to check your eligibility. If you are unable to use
the Online
Physical Presence Calculator, you may complete the How
to Calculate Physical Presence (CIT 0407) (opens in new tab) . You do not have to sign or date your physical presence calculation
(your printout of the Online Physical Presence Calculator or form CIT 0407).
You may be able to use some of your time spent in Canada as an authorized temporary
resident or protected person towards your physical presence calculation. Each day
spent physically in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person before
becoming a permanent resident within the last five (5) years, will count as one half
day, with a maximum of 365 days towards your physical presence.
Temporary resident status includes lawful authorization to enter or remain in Canada as a:
visitor,
student,
worker or,
temporary resident permit holder
Note: If you were issued work or study permits while your refugee claim and/or Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) was being assessed, these documents did not grant you temporary resident status. You can’t claim temporary resident time for those periods.
A protected person is someone who:
was found to be in need of protection or a convention refugee by the
Immigration and Refugee Board
or
received a positive decision on a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment from Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada.
If you are claiming time as a Protected Person, the only time allowed is the time
from when you received a positive Protected Person decision on your refugee claim or
PRRA application until the day before you became a Permanent Resident.
Enter the “To” date from your physical presence calculator. This date is the
last day in your eligibility period which is found on the physical presence
summary or printout.
There are very rare situations that will allow you to count time outside of
Canada towards your physical presence calculation. If you resided outside of
Canada because either:
you; and/or
your Canadian citizen or permanent resident spouse or common law
partner; or
your permanent resident parent
were employed outside Canada (not as a locally engaged person) in or with:
the Canadian Armed Forces
the federal public administration
the public service of a province or territory
Select yes from the drop down menu, complete the Residence
Outside Canada (CIT 0177) (opens in new tab)  and submit any
supporting documents requested in that form with your application.
If you have no time to count, select no and continue to the next
question without filling out the form CIT0177.
Question 11

mailing codes. Press the plus (+) button if you need more space. You don’t need to
include addresses of family, friends, hotels or resorts where you stayed while on vacation.
Provide information that covers the 5-year eligibility period. Do not leave
any gaps during this period and do not leave this section blank. If you do, your
application will be returned to you as incomplete.
Note: If the minor was not alive during part of their eligibility period, use their date of birth as the start of their eligibility period.
Question 12

citizenship in any other country outside of Canada (e.g. your country of birth)
Check either “Yes” or “No”.
If you check “Yes”, complete the chart.

provide that information, including the location.
If you were self-employed, you must provide details of your
self-employment.
If you have multiple occupations/activities that are present, type
“present” instead of putting a date.
You must provide information that covers the five (5) year eligibility
period, being sure to account for each month.
Do not leave any gaps during this period and do not leave this
section blank. If you do, your application will be returned to
you
Note: If the minor was not alive during part of their
eligibility period, use their date of birth as the start of their
eligibility period
Income tax information
Question 14
To determine if the minor was required, under the Income Tax Act, to file
income taxes, please refer to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) information on Newcomers
to Canada (immigrants). To check the minor’s personal tax information, you
may refer to the CRA’s My
Account online service.
If you have one, provide the 9-digit number for your
social
insurance number (SIN)
temporary tax number (TTN), and/or
individual tax number (ITN)
In the chart, tell us about your income tax filing for the last 5 years.
Under the Required to file column

you needed to file a tax return that year
check “No” if you didn’t need
to file a tax return that year
Under the Taxes filed column
check “Yes” if you filed a tax
return that year
check “No” if you didn’t file a tax return that year
Note: The tax years are auto generated once you enter your
eligibility period in question 9. Additionally, you need to complete this
chart in full even if you didn’t live in Canada for part of your 5 year
eligibility period.
Select “Yes” to authorize the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to
provide details of the minor’s tax filing information (including income,
benefit, and residence information) to IRCC. By selecting “Yes”
you are also authorizing IRCC to collect the minor’s tax filing information from
the CRA to help determine whether the minor meets the income tax requirement and
physical presence requirement for citizenship as well as to examine the minor’s
tax information in activities to support quality assurance and integrity in the
citizenship program.
Please note that if consent is not provided, the application will be returned as
incomplete and will not be processed.

Tell us if the minor held travel documents and/or passports during their five (5)
year eligibility period by checking the appropriate box Check either yes or no.
If you check yes, complete the chart:

the minor became a permanent resident if this happened less than five years ago
If the minor does not have a travel document or passport that was/is valid during
their five (5) year eligibility period or there are gaps of time between the
validity of any passports or travel documents, explain why in the space provided.
Prohibitions
Question 16
Certain conditions outlined in the Citizenship Act may affect a minor’s application
for citizenship. Answer all of the questions by selecting yes or no. For any yes responses provide details for the
minor.
IRCC does not need to know if a minor has been found guilty of an offence under the Youth Criminal Justice Act if the sentence was a youth sentence and it has
successfully been completed.
Check the declaration to confirm to confirm that you have read and understood
the situations
that prevent the minor from becoming a Canadian citizen.
If you checked yes to any of the situations
that prevent the minor from becoming a Canadian citizen provide details
in the explanation box
Note: IRCC checks with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
and the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) to find out if there
are any criminal or security reasons which could prevent the minor from
acquiring Canadian citizenship. Also, the minor’s entry to Canada and status
will be verified with Immigration officials.
The minor’s fingerprints and/or court documents may be required to ensure that the
minor is not prohibited under the Citizenship Act. Please do not include
fingerprints and/or court documents in the application. If needed, a separate
request will be sent by IRCC. The minor may also need to attend an in-person
interview. If you receive a notice to appear, both you and the minor must attend the
interview.
warning: The minors’ citizenship can be
taken away (revoked) if, at the time they take the oath (required if 14 years of
age or older), you or the minor knows that any of the above prohibitions apply
to the minor.
Citizenship Certificate Type
Question 17
If your application is approved you will be issued a citizenship certificate as proof of citizenship. Citizenship certificates come in either paper or electronic (printable PDF) format. Citizens can have only one type of certificate but are allowed to print a copy of their electronic certificate.
Check the box next to the type of citizenship certificate that you would like to receive, either paper or electronic citizenship certificate.
Unless you have requested a paper certificate, you must provide an email address in the application form to receive your e-certificate.
Consent and oath of citizenship
Question 18
Select “Yes” if you authorize IRCC to provide your personal information to your federal Member of Parliament (MP).
Select either “Yes” or “No” to indicate if the person applying on behalf of the minor authorizes IRCC to disclose the minor’s name, residential address, and preferred official language to the minor’s federal Member of Parliament so that a letter of congratulations can be sent if the minor becomes a Canadian citizen. No other information will be forwarded.
Question 19
Select “Yes” or “No” to indicate if a minor under 14 years of age wishes to participate in a citizenship ceremony and take the oath of citizenship. Minors under 14 years of age are not required to attend a citizenship ceremony to take the oath of citizenship. Generally, citizenship certificates are mailed to the applicant.
Note: Minors aged 14 and over must take the oath of citizenship.
If a minor aged 14 and over is unable to take the oath of citizenship due to compassionate grounds, they can request a waiver of the oath of citizenship.
To request an oath waiver for minors aged 14-17 due to a medical reason, please provide a Medical Opinion Form for Citizenship Waivers (CIT 0547) (opens in new tab) , filled out by a medical professional licensed to practice in Canada. You should also provide any additional documentation that we should consider with the waiver request.
To request an oath waiver for minors aged 14-17 due to other compassionate grounds, please provide a Waiver Request Form for Minor Applicants [CIT 0554] (opens in new tab)  with any additional documents that support the request.
Requesting a waiver does not guarantee it will be approved. Waiver requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Signature and validation barcodes
Question 20
Sign the form
The person applying on behalf of the minor (i.e. the person who checked question 1 stating that they have custody of the minor, or are empowered to act on behalf of the minor by virtue of a court order or written agreement or by operation of law) must sign the application. Please print and sign the application form with the signature you currently use on other official documents.
Minor applicants between the ages of 14 and 17 years of age must also sign the application.
If the minor is requesting a waiver of the requirement for a person with custody of the minor or who is empowered to act on the minor’s behalf to make the application, the minor must check the box under the signature box declaring that they cannot obtain the necessary signature of the person who can make the application, and are therefore requesting a waiver of this requirement.
When this box is checked, we will consider the request and may ask for supporting documents or evidence to support the decision to be taken on the minor’s waiver request regarding the signature of the guardian or person empowered to act on their behalf.
Type the city where you are applying from
Type the date you will sign the application. The date you sign the application
must be the same date as the application date in the printout of your Online
Physical Presence Calculator.
Print and provide a handwritten signature.
Note: Your application will be returned to you if it is:
not signed and dated
dated more than 90 days before we receive it
post-dated (dated into the future)
Make sure that the date of signature on the application and the application date on the physical presence calculator printout are
the same.
The minor must be eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship the day before you sign the application form.

Consent to disclose personal information
Section 11
Question 11A
Check either Yes or No to indicate whether or not you authorize IRCC to give your name, residential and mailing address, gender, date of birth, Unique Client Identifier (UCI) and the date your citizenship was granted to Elections Canada in order to add you to the National Register of Electors (the Register).
When you become a Canadian citizen and are 18 years of age or older, you have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums. Elections Canada maintains the Register and uses it during a federal election or referendum to produce voters lists and to communicate with eligible voters.
The Canada Elections Act also allows Elections Canada to provide voter information to provincial and territorial election agencies for uses permitted under their respective legislations and to provide voter information (name, address, and gender only) to members of Parliament, registered political parties and candidates at election time. The UCI and the date your citizenship was granted will only be used by Elections Canada for administrative purposes, and will not be shared by Elections Canada except as required by law.
If you check Yes, IRCC will provide your name, residential and mailing address, gender, date of birth, UCI and the date your citizenship was granted to Elections Canada in order to add you to the Register, but only after you become a Canadian citizen. If you check No, IRCC will not provide your information to Elections Canada.
You will still have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums, but you will have to take the necessary steps to be added to the list.
More information about the Register and its uses is available at Election Canada. You can also call Elections Canada at 1-800-463-6868.

Your application for citizenship will in no way be affected by your answer to this question.
The Election Act allows the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec to:
provide voter information to provincial political parties and members of the National Assembly as well as municipal and school boards to compile and update lists of electors (voters) for municipal and school elections, and
notify the elector in writing that their name has been entered on the permanent list of electors, requesting that the elector correct or complete the information which concerns him/her, where required.
The Chief Electoral Officer of Québec receives the UCI for administrative purposes only, while the date your citizenship was granted allows him/her to validate that you qualify as an elector based on the electoral laws it administers. This information is subject to no other use or communication.
If you do not provide this authorization, you will still be able to vote, but you will have to go to the revision office and present two supporting documents to register your name on the list of electors to be able to vote in a provincial, municipal or school election.

A. National Register of Electors – Authorization

When you become a Canadian citizen and are 18 years of age or older, you have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums. Elections Canada maintains the Register and uses it during a federal election or referendum to produce voters lists and to communicate with eligible voters.
If you check the Yes box, IRCC will provide your name, address, gender and date of birth to Elections Canada to be added to the Register, but only after you become a Canadian citizen. If you check the No box, IRCC will not provide your information to Elections Canada. You will still have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums, but you will have to take the necessary steps to be added to the list.
More information about the Register and its uses is available at Elections Canada. You can also call Elections Canada at 1-800-463-6868.
B. Québec’s Permanent List of Electors – Authorization
For Québec residents only.
When you resume your Canadian citizenship, you will have the right to vote. As soon as you become a Canadian citizen, you may want to have your name entered on Québec’s Permanent List of Electors.
What is Québec’s Permanent List of Electors?
The Permanent List of Electors is the registry of persons who are entitled to vote during elections and referendums in Québec. Those persons whose names appear on this list have the right to vote in provincial, municipal and school elections. The Chief Electoral Officer of Québec is responsible for drawing up and updating the Permanent List of Electors.
If you check the “yes” box in Section 13 (b):
You authorize IRCC to provide your name, address, gender and date of birth to the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec so that your name can be added to the Permanent List of Electors if you become a Canadian citizen.
If you check the “no” box in Section 13 (b):
IRCC will not give your information to the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec;
To be able to vote in a provincial, municipal or school election, you will have to go to the revision office and present two supporting documents to register your name on the list of electors.
Your personal information is protected.
Under the Election Act of Québec, the information provided by IRCC to the Chief Electoral Officer may only be used for election purposes. The computer systems of IRCC and those of the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec are not linked. IRCC will not disclose to the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec the information needed to register you on the Permanent List of Electors without your consent.
For more information, call toll-free: 1-888-ELECTION (1-888-353-2846) or visit the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec.
C. Service History with the Canadian Armed Forces
Check Yes box to authorize IRCC to contact the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) or the Department of National Defence (DND) to verify the details of your service and to use the information to determine your citizenship eligibility. By selecting “Yes” you are also authorising the CAF or the DND to provide the details of your service to IRCC.
D. Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
Subsection 8(1) of the Privacy Act and paragraph 241(5)(b) of the Income Tax Act allows the CRA to provide personal information to IRCC, with the consent of the relevant individuals.
This consent is required under paragraph 12(2)(f) of the Citizenship Regulations.
Check Yes box to authorize the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to provide details of your tax filing information to IRCC. By selecting Yes you are also authorizing IRCC to collect your tax filing information from the CRA in order to determine whether you meet the income tax requirement for citizenship.

Section 15

The application must explain how the SAH will ensure sufficient resources are available, provide details on the source of funds (fundraising, use of trust funds, etc.), and demonstrate the sustainability of any planned fundraising or income-generating activities.
If you plan to work with constituent groups or co-sponsors, how will you make sure each constituent group or co-sponsor has sufficient resources to provide the required financial support to the refugees they wish to sponsor?

Access to IOM support
International Organization for Migration (IOM) services include: Intra- and Inter- country
travel arrangements and logistics, securing exit permits, interpretation, and
pre-embarkation health checks. Even if you do not require IOM assistance for travel
arrangements, you are eligible to access the Canadian
Orientation
Abroad (COA) program. Unless you tell us
not to, if your application is approved you will be referred to the IOM for a COA session
for EMPP applicants. This is a general orientation to life in Canada that will help you
prepare for your move, and connect you to free settlement services after you arrive in
Canada – such as language training.
Immigration Loans Program (ILP):
The Immigration Loans Program (ILP) provides eligible immigrants with access to funding that
would otherwise not be available to them. Loans are used to cover a number of expenses,
including travel to Canada and other costs associated with immigration, specifically
defraying the cost of transportation to Canada (transportation loan), and defraying the cost
of the right of permanent residence fee (RPRF loan).
The objective of the transportation loan is to provide financial assistance to
eligible applicants to cover the costs of transportation for themselves and their beneficiaries
from overseas to their place of final destination in Canada. This includes approved service fees
from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as well as other related expenses.
Any applicants who chose to book their own travel will not be issued a transportation
loan.
Before issuing a loan, an officer will assess your situation according to your need,
ability to repay and if applicable settlement funds already available.

Section D – Immigration Loans
If you are deemed eligible under this public policy, you are eligible for a transportation loan under Canada’s
Immigration Loans Program (ILP).
Note:
All travelers are responsible for their travel costs to Canada. The ILP Transportation Loan provides financial
assistance to eligible applicants to cover the costs of transportation to Canada.
Travel is booked by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). There is a CAD $300 per person travel
booking assistance fee paid to IOM that provides benefits and supports for travelers. This fee is added to the
loan in addition to the airfare costs. For more details on what IOM’s travel booking assistance includes, follow
this link: International
Organization for Migration.
If you do not have a passport and will be traveling on a Single-Journey Travel Document issued by Canada, it is
recommended that you use IOM’s travel booking assistance in order to access IOM’s support to apply for an exit
permit.
The following options are available for your travel arrangements. Please confirm which option you will be
using:
Option A: ILP Transportation Loan supported by IOM’s Travel Booking Assistance
Option B: Pay for travel on my own (no ILP) but with IOM’s Travel Booking Assistance only (available in limited locations)
If you choose to use IOM’s travel booking assistance, and are traveling from Ethiopia, Kenya,
Nigeria, and Tanzania only, you have the option to pay for IOM’s travel booking assistance
and your travel costs directly to IOM, rather than having these costs placed on an ILP transportation
loan.
You will not have access to an ILP transportation loan.
Option C: I will make all of my own travel arrangements. I am not seeking any support from IOM.
You will not have access to an ILP transportation loan.

Section J – Assessment of financial capacity
For the purpose of calculating the financial capacity only, the principal applicants non-accompanying family members should not be counted in the family size calculation. You should only count family members that will be travelling with you to Canada.
However, keep in mind that all family members, whether accompanying or non-accompanying,
must be declared on the Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008).
You must provide sufficient evidence to show you have enough money to act as an anchor.
To assess your financial capacity to act as an anchor, the officer will review the forms and all
the financial documents you submitted. You are required to submit sufficient information and
evidence to demonstrate that you have sufficient financial means to support the principal
applicant and their family members.
What is your family size? (for option A or C only)
Family size for financial capacity calculation includes:
You (the anchor)
Your spouse or common-law
partner (even if they are not living with you)
Your dependent
children (even if they are not living with you)
Their dependent children, if they have any
Your spouse’s or common-law partner’s dependent children , and
Their dependent children, if they have any
The principal applicant (foreign national)
The principal applicant’s spouse or common-law partner (if accompanying the principal
applicant to Canada)
The dependent children of the principal applicant and principal applicant’s spouse or
common-law partner (if accompanying the principal applicant to Canada)
The dependent children of the dependent children, if they have any and if accompanying the
principal applicant to Canada
Any other person that you and your co-signer (if you have one) sponsored or co-signed, whom
they’re still financially responsible for (for example, sponsored refugees) and their
family members
Any other person for whom you (and/or the co-anchor, if you have one) have submitted a
statutory declaration to support them under this public policy, not listed in this statutory
declaration. If you are submitting multiple applications, you must include in your family
size all foreign nationals (principal applicants) and their accompanying family members for
whom you have submitted a statutory declaration under this public policy.
The information provided in the family size
calculation will be compared to the information contained in IRCC’s database.
Examples:
For option A:
Anchor + spouse (married with a sponsorship application in progress) = 2
Principal applicant #1 (single , no children) = 1
Principal applicant #2 + spouse + 3 children = 5
Total family size : 8. The minimum necessary income needed is $85,666
For option B:
Principal applicant #1 + spouse = 2  persons  funds needed $14,950
Principal applicant #2 (single, no children) = 1 persons funds needed $9,900 Totals funds needed : $14,950 + $9,900 = $24,850
For Option C:
Anchor + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)
Principal applicant #1 + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)
Principal applicant #2 + spouse (2 people)
Total family size = 10 persons The minimum necessary income is $101,498
If your income is $55,000 you need $46,498 of available funds (Total minimum necessary income - your income).
How much income and/or funds are available?
In order to act as an anchor, you must meet the financial requirement of one of the three options
described below.
Option A - Minimum necessary Income (MNI)
Refer to the low income cut-off table (Table 1) and the amount required
according to the number of people you entered in the family size calculation above. This is the
amount of income you must have to act as an anchor.
You can still act as an anchor if you are receiving maternity, parental and sickness benefits
paid under the Employment Insurance Act. These benefits also count as income for the
purposes of meeting the Minimum necessary income.
The income requirement is based on Statistics Canada’s annual Low-income Cut-Off (LICO).
Federal Income Table, 2024

6 persons

7 persons
$77,750
More than 7 persons, for each additional person, add
$7,916
Option B - Minimum necessary funds
The minimum necessary funds is an amount held in an in-trust account at a
Canadian financial institution. The funds must be accessible to the foreign national once
granted permanent residence in Canada. The total number of persons is equal in number to the
foreign national (principal applicant) and their accompanying family members.

Option C – Combination of income and funds
If you do not meet the minimum necessary income requirements described in Option A or the minimum
necessary funds under Option B, you can use a combination of income and funds to meet financial
requirement.
To determine if you meet the requirement for Option C, you must use this formula:
Example 1:
The minimum necessary income (MNI) required for a family size of 7 is $77,750.
Your income is $60,000 + funds in your in-trust account is $20,000 = $80,000.
As the combination of income and funds is higher than MNI of $77, 750, you would be financially eligible to act as an Anchor.
Example 2:
If you are acting as an anchor for more than one application you must have separate in-trust
accounts for each principal applicant.
For example:
Anchor + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)
Sibling A + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)
Sibling B + spouse (2 people)
Total = 10 persons
In this scenario, Sibling A and Sibling B are both principal applicants with their own statutory
declarations and must each have a separate in-trust account.
The minimum necessary income to support 10 people (Sibling A + Sibling B + Anchor and all dependents) = $101,498
If your income is $55,000 you need $46,498 of available funds (totally funds necessary- your income).
Divide the available funds necessary into trust accounts for Sibling A and Sibling B based on
their family size.
$46,498 divided by 6 persons (Sibling A + Sibling B+ their dependents)= $7,749 per person
Trust Account for Sibling A (4 persons x $7,749) available funds = $30,998
Trust Account for Sibling B (2 persons x $7,749) available funds = $15,499
Funds held in an in-trust account
The funds must remain in the account until the principal applicant arrives and must be deposited
to an account held at a Canadian financial institution in Canadian currency.
This account does not need to be a formal trust account.
This account can be an informal in-trust chequing or savings account.
Section K – Declaration of extended family member (Anchor
and co-anchor, if applicable)
Read all of the statements in all sections carefully.
Write your complete name and the name of the foreign national identified in section B.
Check the box to tell us the relationship between yourself and the foreign national. If you check

Financial Evaluation form (IMM 1283)
Quebec residents do not need to complete this form
The Financial Evaluation form (IMM 1283) will help you assess if you (and your spouse or
common-law partner, if he or she is co-signing the undertaking) will have the financial ability
to support the persons you are planning to sponsor and their family members.
If you are sponsoring a person other than:
your spouse, common-law or conjugal partner who has no family members, or
your spouse, common-law or conjugal partner who has dependent children who have no dependent
children of their own, or
your child who has no children of his or her own,
you must prove that you have an annual income that is at least equal to the minimum necessary
income to support the group of persons consisting of:
yourself and your family members, whether they are living with you or not;
the person you are sponsoring and his or her family members;
every other person you have sponsored in the past and their family members, where an
undertaking is still in effect or is not yet in effect;
every other person for whom you have co-signed an undertaking that is still in effect or is
not yet in effect; and
every person not included above for whom your spouse or common-law partner has given or
co-signed an undertaking that is still in effect or is not yet in effect, if your spouse or
common-law partner is co-signing your current sponsorship undertaking.
If you declared bankruptcy and are required to meet settlement arrangements, income earned during
the period of the bankruptcy cannot be considered.
Expand all
Collapse all
Co-signer
If you have to meet financial requirements and do not have enough money to sponsor your relatives
on your own, your spouse or common-law partner may help you meet the income requirement by
co-signing the undertaking.
The co-signer must:
meet the same eligibility requirements as the sponsor;
agree to co-sign your application to sponsor; and,
agree to be responsible for the basic requirements of the persons you want to sponsor and
their family members for the term of the undertaking.
The co-signer will be equally liable if commitments are not met. If you are sponsoring a spouse,
common-law or conjugal partner, you cannot have a co-signer. If you are sponsoring a dependent
child who does not have children of his or her own, you do not need a co-signer.
Assets, potential earnings, or assistance from other family members will not be considered.
If your spouse or common-law partner is co-signing your sponsorship undertaking, make sure you
complete questions 1.B and 15
to 19.
Social assistance
Social assistance means any benefit, whether money, goods or services, provided to or on behalf
of a person by a province under a program of social assistance. It includes assistance for food,
shelter, clothing, fuel, utilities, household supplies, personal requirements and health care
not provided by public health care.
Family members and persons included in undertakings in effect or not yet in effect
The minimum income you will need to meet the requirements of your sponsorship undertaking is
determined in part by the number of persons described in questions 2 to 6. For each group
described in questions 3 and 4, enter the number of persons included in that group and give
details of each person in the group as instructed on the form. We have already entered 1 in the
box in question 2 to account for yourself. If you have a spouse or common-law partner and
he or she is not included in 3, complete question 5; provide details as required. Enter in 6 the
number of your other family members not included in 2, 3, 4 or 5; give details of each person in
the group as instructed on the form. Read each description carefully. Add the numbers entered in
each of the boxes provided for the number of persons in questions 2, 3, 4 and, if
applicable, 5 and 6. Enter the total in the box provided at question 7. This total and
the low income cut-off table will help you determine the minimum amount you will need to
sponsor.
Minimum necessary income
Refer to the low income cut-off table (Table 1) and go
down the column until you come to the line that matches the number of people as determined in
Box 7. This is the amount of income you must have to sponsor your
relatives. Enter that amount in the box at question 8.
Quebec residents should refer to MIFI’s Financial capacity evaluation webpage to determine if they have
the financial ability to meet Quebec’s sponsorship requirements.

Your available income
Make sure you provide all the required information regarding the income you earned over the
twelve months preceding the mailing of your application (questions 10 to 14) and, if
you have a co-signer, the income he or she earned over that same period (questions 15 to 19).
The office processing your application may ask you for additional information and documentation
if it is not satisfied you have provided sufficient evidence to sustain your income calculation.
Your available income is the amount of money you have earned in the period of 12 months preceding
the date of your application, excluding any allowance or benefit of the type described in 12.B
below.
To calculate your available income, you will need a document called Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
Notice of Assessment. You can view (and print) your tax return(s) as well as other personal tax
information using the CRA’s My Account online service. To register or login, visit My Account. Your spouse or common-law partner
will also have to obtain a Notice of Assessment if he or she is co-signing the undertaking.
If you are unable to obtain and produce a Notice of Assessment or if your income reported in this
document is less than your minimum necessary income, you will need to provide documentation
establishing the amount of income you earned over the period of 12 months preceding the date of
your application, such as: pay stubs, if you are employed; a statement of business of
activities, if you are self-employed; bank statements, if you have received interest income;
statements or certificates, if you have other sources of income (investment, rental, pension,
special benefits paid under the Employment Insurance Act, etc.). Your spouse or common-law
partner will need to provide similar documentation if he or she is co-signing the undertaking
and does not produce a Notice of Assessment or if the income reported on your spouse or
common-law partner’s Notice of Assessment combined with your available income is less than your
minimum necessary income.
To calculate your earned income, complete question 12 (calculation based on the “Notice of
Assessment”) on the Financial Evaluation form with the help of the instructions below. If you
are not producing a “Notice of Assessment” or if your total income calculated as per question 12
of the Financial Evaluation form is less than your minimum necessary income, complete question
13 (calculation based on preceding 12 months) on the Financial Evaluation form. The greater of
the two amounts entered at 12.C and 13.C is your available income; enter this amount in box 14.
If your spouse or common-law partner is co-signing the undertaking, you will have to complete
question 17 (calculation based on the “Notice of Assessment”) and/or question 18 (calculation
based on preceding 12 months) to calculate his or her earned income. The greater of the two
amounts entered at 17.C and 18.C will be your co-signer’s available income; enter this amount in
box 19.
The total of boxes 14 and 19 will be the total income that is available to you to support your
application to sponsor. This total must at least be equal to the amount of the minimum necessary
income (see box 8) you need to sponsor.
Question 11. – Your situation over the last 12 months
In the table in question 11, complete the sections (A, B and/or C) which apply to your situation
during the 12 months preceding the date of your application. If your situation changed during
that period, in the Period I column, enter information on the most recent period and, in the
next columns, enter information on the previous period(s), which make(s) up the rest of the 12
months preceding your application.
For each of the employers you worked for during the period of 12 months preceding the date of
your application and from which you have received or will receive a T-4 slip, give details about
your employment in section B, including your personal employment income.
Personal employment income is defined as the gross income earned from your job(s) as reported to
CRA from a T4.
If you were self-employed, give details about your business in section C, including your
personal business income. Personal business income is defined as the net income
earned (or loss incurred) and reported to CRA from activities conducted for profit from a sole
proprietorship, partnership or unincorporated business. This would include professions, trades
and businesses such as small retail outlets and restaurants. Income from other personal
self-employment endeavours such as farming, fishing, commission sales,
consulting and child care that are conducted for profit should also be included.
Be careful to indicate clearly the reference period (first line at the beginning of each section
you complete). For example, if the date of your application was June 5, 2004, and you were
self-employed during the 12 months preceding your application, you would complete section C in
the Period I column, providing on the first line of that section the start (June 6, 2003) and
the end (June 5, 2004) of the 12-month period. However, if you had been working for an employer
for only six months, were self-employed for the two months before you were hired and, before
that, were unemployed, you would first complete section B in the Period I column, indicating
your employment information and, on the first line of that section, the date you were hired
(December 1, 2003 for the purpose of our example) and the date of your application (June 5,
2004). Then you would complete section C in the Period II column, providing information about
your self-employment and, on the first line of that section, the date that your activities
started (September 28, 2003 for the purpose of our example) and ended (November 30,
2003). Lastly, you would complete section A in the Period III column, indicating
income you earned from sources other than employment (for example, pension income or special
benefits paid under the Employment Insurance Act – see questions 12 and 13 for
details) and, on the first line of that section, the period during which you were unemployed
(June 6, 2003, to September 27, 2003).
If you need additional space, provide details on a separate sheet.
Question 12. – Calculation of income based on the “Notice of Assessment”
12.A: Print the amount that appears at line 150 of the last Notice of Assessment
issued to you by the CRA for the most recent taxation year.
12.B: Enter all of the following payments that were included in the amount at
line 150 of your Notice of Assessment, add them up and print the total:
Provincial instruction or training allowance;
Social assistance paid by a province;
Guaranteed income supplement paid under the Old Age Security Act;
and
Employment insurance: maternity, parental and sickness benefits paid under
the Employment Insurance Act are considered income. Other payments such as
employment insurance and federal training allowances are not considered as income.
12.C: Deduct the total entered at 12.B (line 6) from the amount at 12.A (line
1). The result 12.C is your total income as per this method of calculation.
Question 13 – Calculation of income based on preceding 12 months
Complete question 13 if
you cannot produce a Notice of Assessment or a document from My CRA account for the most
recent taxation year preceding the date of your application to sponsor, or
you can produce a Notice of Assessment but the amount at line 150 is less than the minimum
necessary income (see definition above) and your financial circumstances have improved since
you received the notice of assessment.
13.A: Personal income from employment, business and self-employment
Add all personal income from employment, business and other self-employment earned in the 12
months preceding the date of your application to sponsor, as instructed. Enter the result on
line 5 in section 13.A.
13.B: Other income
Calculate income that you received from other sources. Use the following definitions:
Net rental income: net income earned (or loss incurred) and reported to CRA
from rental property.
Investment and interest income: income reported to and accepted by CRA from
dividend payments, interest, stocks, bonds and other investments and, interest on savings
deposits.
Pension income: income from Old Age Security, Canada/Quebec Pension Plan,
other pensions, superannuation and annuity payments from Canadian sources. Do not include

If a settlement plan is submitted even though it is not requested or required, it will be
assessed as part of the application.
When completing the Settlement Plan, ensure the following:
Be as precise and detailed as possible.
Do not leave any questions blank.
Note that, the officer assessing your application does not know you and cannot make
assumptions on the services you will be providing to the refugees.
Each settlement plan must address the unique needs of the PA and their dependents.
Include details of your plan to the unique needs of the PA and their dependents
whether they are accompanying the PA in Canada or not.
Your answers should not be copied from other settlement plans.
Do not include the needs of linked cases
Linked applications listed in Section E – Linked/Multiple Sponsorship Applications
on the PA’s Sponsorship Undertaking require separate sponsorship applications.
Settlement Needs Checklist (Plan B and C only)
Check the box to indicate who will provide for the settlement needs of the refugees over the
duration of the sponsorship period. Where more than one party is providing for a particular
need, check all boxes that apply.
If a need is not applicable to your case, check the box under “not applicable”. A new field will
appear where you must explain why that need does not apply.
Housing Plans:
When you check the box to indicate who will be responsible for ensuring housing plans are in
place, more fields will appear:
Question 1 – Please explain what housing arrangements will be made for the
refugee(s)
Provide details of your planned housing arrangement, including the following:
type of building (high-rise apartment, townhouse, detached house, shared accommodation,
etc.)
number and type of rooms available to the sponsored refugees (number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
types of living areas, basement, kitchen etc.)

If you are arranging temporary housing upon arrival, provide details about the accommodation as

details of the permanent housing you expect to arrange
If shelter is being donated in-kind (at no cost), explain if it is being donated by:
a member of the sponsoring group (and if so, which member(s); or
a third party that is not a member of the sponsoring group
For SAHs in Plan C, refer to options for providing in-kind shelter

Financial Needs Checklist (Plan B and C only):
Check each box to confirm that each financial need will be provided to the refugee(s). This
includes one-time startup costs and ongoing monthly costs. See Appendix A
for more information on financial requirements of sponsorship.
Sponsorship Cost Estimate (Plan C only):
This section is used to estimate your overall sponsorship costs. This is only a rough estimate
and will be used by IRCC to determine if you have enough money to sponsor all of the refugees in
your application, including non-accompanying family members. This estimate is based on the
Sponsorship Cost Table, which is an average of all the provincial/territorial social assistance
rates in Canada.
The form will automatically populate the cost table amount based on the number of family members
you enter in Section B, but you are encouraged to refer to Appendix A for
more information on how to calculate your cost estimate, including maximum in-kind deduction
amounts.
Depending on where you live, this cost estimate may be higher or lower than the
actual amount of money you need to provide to the refugees after they arrive in
Canada. This actual amount of money is based on the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) rates
and policies in the community where the refugee will live.
Please see the Post-arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships for information on the actual amount of
money you will need to provide after the refugees arrive in Canada.
Please contact the Refugee Sponsorship Training
Program (RSTP) for information on the actual amount of money you will need to provide
after the refugees arrive in Canada.
I. Minimum Financial Requirement
The family size and minimum financial requirement will be automatically calculated based on the
information you enter in section B. For reference purposes, the minimum expected amount of money
to sponsor is indicated in the Sponsorship Cost Table (Appendix A).
II. In-kind Deductions
In this section, you can deduct costs for items you are donating.
Use the In-kind Deduction Table in Appendix A.
Enter the in-kind deduction amount for each donated item.
Pay attention to the maximum allowable deductions for each item.
If the amount you enter is more than the maximum allowable deduction for the family size,
you will get an error message and that amount will be deleted.
Enter shelter donations amount only if the donor is party to the sponsorship undertaking
(See the following section on options for providing in-kind shelter).
Options for providing in-kind shelter:
Shelter may be donated fully in-kind as long as it is safe, secure and suitable for the size of
the family unit, and provided to the refugee(s) without cost.
In-kind shelter can be provided by anyone other than a refugee that is within their sponsorship
period.
Sponsors have the following options for demonstrating in-kind shelter:
If housing is being donated by a member of the sponsorship group included as a
signatory to the sponsorship undertaking:
The sponsoring group does not need to demonstrate that funds are in place to provide
housing and may enter the full in-kind shelter amount in this section of the form.
If housing is being donated by someone that isn’t a member of the sponsoring group,
chose one of the following options:
Add the donor as a party to the sponsorship; or
Submit a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the third party and the SAH
detailing agreed upon housing arrangements; or
Demonstrate in the proof of funds that 100% of the minimum required shelter amount
per Sponsorship Cost tables (see Appendix A) is in place to
provide housing in case the third party support becomes unavailable. While shelter
may still be provided fully in-kind post-arrival, the sponsor must demonstrate that
funds are available at the application-stage as a contingency measure.
III. Total Financial Requirement
This section will automatically calculate your total financial requirement for sponsorship
by subtracting the in-kind deductions (I) from the minimum financial requirement (II).
IV. Total Committed Funds
In this section, you must enter:
The funds held in trust; and/or
the amount of money each individual co-sponsor is committing to the sponsorship, if
applicable. For each individual co-sponsor that is contributing personal income,
including contributions to funds held in trust, you must also submit a Financial Profile (IMM 5373B) (opens in a new tab)
V. Assessment of Financial Capacity
This section will indicate if your group has enough funds to sponsor. The form will automatically
subtract the Total Financial Requirement in section III from the Total Committed Funds in
section IV.
If your group has committed enough funds:
the balance will be positive
If your group has not committed enough funds:
the balance will be negative
The sponsorship application will be refused if the group has not committed enough
funds.
Section E - Signatures
Each sponsor must sign and date the application
By signing here, each member of the sponsoring group declares that they understand
and commit to upholding the terms outlined on the Sponsorship Undertaking (all SAH
plans) and Settlement Plan (Plans B and C only), in accordance with the Post-Arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships.
If a signature is missing or if it is dated more than 90 days prior to the date of
submission at ROC-O, the application will be returned to you without being
processed.
As the sponsors, you must ensure that all the information contained in the application is
accurate at the time of submission at ROC-O
If there are changes to your sponsoring group’s composition or changes to your PA’s family
composition at any stage in processing, a new Sponsorship Undertaking must be submitted.

Request for a Refugee Profile (IMM 5438)
Who must fill out this application form?
This form can be completed by:
the sponsor
Section A – Visa Office-Referred Cases
There are various types of visa-office referred cases. Indicate which type of case your group
is
interested in, according to the descriptions given below. You may select more than one case
type.
Visa office-referred
An officer determines if a refugee(s) meets the eligibility and admissibility
criteria
and then sends a request to ROC-O to find a sponsor.
The sponsorship is normally signed for a 12-month period and requires the sponsor to
provide financial and settlement assistance. Visa office-referred cases have been
interviewed and are ready to travel to Canada once a sponsor is found.
Urgent Protection case
Refugee cases that are identified by the UNHCR as being in need of urgent protection
receive expedited processing under the Urgent Protection program. Most Urgent
Protection
cases arrive in Canada within 3-5 days of being referred by the UNHCR. If you are a
group that may be able to respond to a case quickly, indicate if you are interested
in
this type of profile.
Section B – Type of Family/Individual You Wish to Sponsor
In this section, your group can indicate preferences and limitations you have regarding
family
size, composition, and country of origin of the refugee(s) you can settle. Indicate the
reasons
for your limitations or preferences (e.g. Spanish-speaking because your group has a number
of
people who can act as interpreters).
ROC-O will do its best to match refugees using the information provided by your group. Be
aware
that the more flexible your group is regarding the refugee(s) you can settle, the more
quickly a
potential profile can be sent to you.
Section C – Information on Sponsoring Group
Share relevant background information (personal and professional) about your group that will
facilitate the matching process. Helpful information would include any experience or skills
group members have with special needs.
Section D – Information on Your Community
Provide information about the receiving community. This information is essential in finding
refugee applicant(s) who will adapt quickly and successfully to life in the community."

Read the step by step instructions on how to complete the form.
When to use this form
Complete this form only if you are:
appointing a representative;
updating contact information for your previously appointed representative;
cancelling a representative’s appointment;
cancelling the appointment of a representative and appointing a new representative; or
withdrawing your role as a representative
If you have dependent children aged 18 years or older, they are required to complete their own copy of this form if a
representative is also conducting business on their behalf.
Who is a representative?
A representative is someone who provides advice, consultation, or guidance to you at any stage of
the application process, or in a proceeding and, if you appoint them as your representative by filling out this
form, has your permission to conduct business on your behalf with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada
(IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).
You are not obliged to hire a representative. We treat everyone equally, whether they use the service of a
representative or not.
When you appoint a representative:
you also authorize IRCC and CBSA to share information from your application with this person in place of you.
Please note the representative will receive all correspondence from IRCC or the CBSA, not the
applicant;
your application will not be given special attention nor can you expect faster processing or a more favourable
outcome;
the representative is authorized to represent you only on citizenship or immigration matters related to the
application you submit with this form; and
you can appoint only one (1) representative at a time for each application you submit.
Important information: Notify IRCC about any changes.
You must notify IRCC if your representative’s contact information changes, or if you change your representative, or
cancel the appointment of your representative. For more information on updating IRCC with your representative’s
information, please see the section “How to submit this form” below.
Types of representatives
There are two (2) types of representatives.
Unpaid representatives
Unpaid representatives do not charge fees or receive any other form of consideration or compensation for providing
advice or services to represent you before IRCC or the CBSA.
Unpaid representatives include:
Friends, family members or other third parties who do not, and will not, charge a fee or receive any other
consideration for their advice and services;
consultants, lawyers and Quebec notaries, and students-at-law under their supervision, who do not, and will not,
charge a fee or receive any other consideration to represent you.
Note: You do not have to pay someone for them to be your representative. IRCC will conduct
business with an unpaid representative if an applicant appoints them on their behalf.
Paid representatives
Paid representatives charge a fee or receive some other form of consideration or compensation in exchange for the representation
that they provide.
It is important to know that anyone who represents or advises you for payment - or offers to do so - in connection
with IRCC proceedings or applications is breaking the law unless they are an authorized
representative or they have a specific agreement or arrangement with the Government of Canada that allows them to
represent or advise you. This applies to advice or consultation which happens before or after a citizenship or an
immigration application is made or a proceeding begins.
IRCC will only conduct business with paid representatives who are in good standing with their designated regulatory
body. Find
out if your representative is authorized.
Note: If a representative is being paid or compensated by someone other than you, the
representative is still considered to be a paid representative.
Paid representatives are:
consultants who are members in good standing of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC);
lawyers and paralegals who are members in good standing of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society, and
students-at-law under their supervision;
notaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Québec and
students-at-law under their supervision.
If you appoint a paid representative who is not a member in good standing of one of these designated bodies,
your application will be returned. Learn
about using a representative.
Release of information to other individuals
To authorize IRCC to release information from your application to someone other than a representative, you will need to complete the form Authority to Release Personal Information to a Designated Individual (IMM 5475)  (opens in new tab) .
The person you designate under that form (IMM 5475) will be able to obtain information on your application, such as the status. However, they will not be able to conduct business on your behalf with IRCC.

Settlement Plan– Joint Assistance Sponsorship Form (IMM 5494)
Who must fill out this application form?
This form must be completed by the:
Sponsorship Agreement Holder (SAH)
Constituent Group (if applicable)
What is it?
The Settlement
Plan and Financial Assessment is a planning tool for sponsoring groups
to formulate how they intend to deliver the various aspects of settlement assistance needed
to help the refugee applicant(s) establish successfully in Canada. Where practicable, the
planned arrangements should be in place before the refugee arrives.
In those instances where refugee applicants intend to live together in Canada as a family
unit but are named on separate Undertakings only one Settlement Plan encompassing the entire
household is required. It must, however, reflect the resettlement needs of each individual
being sponsored.
Submission of Settlement Plan
Sponsorship Agreement Holders must complete a Settlement Plan for each JAS undertaking they sign but are
not required to submit the form to the ROC-O (note exception below).
Constituent Groups must also complete a Settlement Plan for each JAS undertaking they sign and must
submit it to their Sponsorship Agreement Holder. The SAH assesses the overall application and,
when satisfied, issues a letter of approval authorizing the group to sponsor under their
agreement. Both the SAH and the
Constituent Group are required to retain a copy of the Settlement Plan in their files.
Note: Exception – Sponsorship Agreement Holders (and their respective
Constituent Groups) that signed an agreement with the Minister less than two years ago
are required to submit the Settlement Plan to the Resettlement Operations
Centre – Ottawa (ROC-O) as part of the sponsorship application.
Section A – General information
Write the complete name of the:

relevant box.
Where more than one party is providing for a particular need, check all boxes that apply.

Answer each question in a detailed yet concise manner.
Note: Joint Assistance Sponsorship cases will receive orientation and
income support through the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP).
This assistance will be provided by the service providers in partnership with sponsoring
groups.
Question 1
If temporarily staying with relatives, provide information on family composition of
the family relatives that the sponsored refugee(s) will be staying with and what
current accommodation arrangements the relatives have. Also, provide details on the
time frame when you anticipate that permanent accommodation will be found and what
type of accommodation you are looking for e.g.
house or apartment.
Question 2
Indicate the names of the individuals that will be volunteering and what tasks they
will be assisting with e.g. arrival, Social
Insurance Number (S.I.N.) application, Health card application, medical
appointments, etc.
Question 3a
Upon indicating the settlement agency, indicate what service(s) the refugee(s) will
be obtaining from that agency e.g. Language
training, translation of documents, etc.
Question 3b
If you have not contacted any agencies to provide settlement support, indicate when
you plan on making this contact. If you have contacted some agencies, indicate the
date, the name of the person you made contact with and in regards to what services.
Also, indicate if you have dealt with these agencies in the past and what type of
services your sponsored refugees have accessed from them.
Question 4
Some contingency plans can include scenarios such as the refugee(s) was or were
originally supposed to reside with a relative in Canada upon arrival; however, they
choose to reside on their own for the duration of the sponsorship period. Provide
some details as to how you will provide support for the additional costs that will
occur. Another scenario could be that the refugee(s) choose to move to a different
city. Provide some details as to how you will continue to provide the required
assistance.
Section D – Signatures

Plan.

Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan – Community Sponsors (IMM 5663)
The Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan (IMM 5663) is used to assess whether
your organization has the capacity to fulfil the financial and non-financial obligations to
support the refugees so they can establish successfully in Canada.
The Signing Authority for the CS, the Signing Authority for the organizational
co-sponsor (if applicable) and individual co-sponsor(s) (if applicable), should discuss
settlement arrangements and responsibilities together and jointly fill out the
settlement plan.
Your organization must support the refugees for 12 months from the date of arrival or
until they become self-sufficient, whichever comes first.
In exceptional cases where the officer abroad had concerns about the refugee’s ability
to become established in Canada (as per R139
(1) (g) of IRPR), sponsors may be asked to provide support for the refugee for
up to 36 months. This is at the discretion of the officer abroad (as per R154
(3) of IRPR) and you may be contacted later in the process if the officer has
made this determination.

Section H – Sponsorship Cost Estimate
This cost estimate will be used by IRCC to assess your financial capacity as part of your
sponsorship application. This is an estimate only, and is based on a the sponsorship cost
table, which is an average of all the provincial/territorial social assistance rates in
Canada. Depending on where you live, this estimate may be higher or lower than the actual
amount of money needed for the sponsorship. The actual amount that you will need to provide
to the refugee(s) after their arrival in Canada is based on the Resettlement Assistance
Program (RAP) rates and policy in the community where the refugee(s) will live. Refer to the
Post-arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships for additional details on
financial requirements for sponsorships
Minimum Financial Requirement
The family size and minimum financial requirement will be automatically calculated
based on the information you enter in section C. The minimum expected amount of
money to sponsor is indicated in the Sponsorship Cost Table (Appendix A).
Estimated living costs in the expected community of settlement
In this section you will create a budget based on annual estimated settlement costs
for the refugees. The budget includes:
start-up costs (items purchased once to help the refugees get established)
ongoing monthly costs (including rent, food, phone and internet, pocket money
and allowances and transportation costs)
For one-time start-up costs, enter the estimated amount for each item.
For ongoing monthly costs, enter the estimated monthly cost. The annual cost column
and total annual living costs fields will be automatically calculated.
The total annual living costs you budget for must be greater than or equal to the
minimum financial requirement in section H (i).
Donations
In this section, you can deduct costs for items you are donating.
Use the In-kind Deduction Table in Appendix A.
Enter the in-kind deduction amount for each donated item.
Pay attention to the maximum allowable deductions for each item.
If the amount you enter is more than the maximum allowable deduction for the
family size, you will get an error message and that amount will be deleted.
Enter shelter donations amount, only if donor is party to the sponsorship
undertaking
Options for providing in-kind shelter:
Shelter may be donated fully in-kind as long as it is safe, secure and suitable for
the size of the family unit, and provided to the refugee(s) without cost.
In-kind shelter can be provided by anyone other than a refugee that is within their
sponsorship period.
Sponsors have the following options for demonstrating in-kind shelter:
If housing is being donated by a member of the sponsorship group
included as a signatory to the sponsorship undertaking:
The sponsoring group does not need to demonstrate that funds are in
place to provide housing and may enter the full in-kind shelter amount
in this section of the form.
If housing is being donated by someone that isn’t a member of the
sponsoring group, chose one of the following options:
Add the donor as a party to the sponsorship; or
Demonstrate in the proof of funds that 100% of the minimum required
shelter amount per Sponsorship Cost tables (see Appendix A ) is in place to provide
housing in case the third party support becomes unavailable. While
shelter may still be provided fully in-kind post-arrival, the sponsor
must demonstrate that funds are available at the application-stage as a
contingency measure.
Financial Requirement
This section will automatically calculate your total financial requirement for
sponsorship by subtracting the in-kind deductions from the estimated annual
living costs.
If your estimated annual living costs are less than the minimum financial
requirement in section H (i), the minimum financial requirement amount will be
used for the calculation instead.
Total Committed Funds
In this section, you must enter the amount of money each individual co-sponsor is
committing and/or the funds held in trust, towards the sponsorship. If an individual
co-sponsor is contributing personal income, enter the amount.
If you are contributing funds in trust, you must explain how they were
obtained and submit proof. If you do not explain how the funds
were obtained, your application may be refused.
Assessment of Financial Capacity
This section will indicate if your group has committed enough funds to sponsor. The
form will automatically subtract the Financial Requirement in section iv from the
Committed Funds in section v.
If your group has committed sufficient funds:
the balance will be positive and a checkmark will appear
If your group has not committed sufficient funds:
the balance will be negative and an X will appear
The sponsorship application may be refused if the group has not committed
sufficient funds.
Section I – Obligations, Consents and Declarations
This section must be read carefully, signed and understood by all parties to the sponsorship.
Section J – Signatures
Each sponsor must sign and date the application:
by signing here, each member of the sponsoring group declares that they
understand and commit to upholding the terms outlined on the sponsorship
undertaking and settlement plan, in accordance with the Post-arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships.

Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan – Groups of Five (IMM 5670)
The Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan – Group of Five (IMM 5670) is used to assess
whether you have the capacity to fulfil your
financial and non-financial obligation to support the refugees so they can establish
successfully in Canada.
All sponsors should discuss settlement arrangements and responsibilities together and
jointly fill out the settlement plan.
You must support the refugees for 12 months from the date of arrival or until they
become self-sufficient, whichever comes first.
In exceptional cases where the officer abroad had concerns about the refugee’s ability
to become established in Canada (as per R139
(1) (g) of IRPR), sponsors may be asked to provide support for the refugee for
up to 36 months. This is at the discretion of the officer abroad (as per R154
(3) of IRPR) and you may be contacted later in the process if the officer has
made this determination.

Question 3 – Do you have a back-up plan if your initial housing plan does not

Please explain your contingency plan if your planned housing arrangement does not work.
Section E – Sponsorship Cost Estimate
This cost estimate will be used by IRCC to assess your financial capacity as part of your
sponsorship application. This is an estimate only, and is based on the sponsorship cost
table, which is an average of all the provincial/territorial social assistance rates in
Canada.  Depending on where you live, this estimate may be higher or lower than the
actual amount of money needed for the sponsorship. The actual amount that you will need to
provide to the refugee(s) after their arrival in Canada is based on the Resettlement
Assistance Program (RAP) rates and policy in the community where the refugee(s) will live.
Refer to the Post-arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships  page for additional details on
financial requirements for sponsorships.
i. Minimum Financial Requirement
The family size and minimum financial requirement will be automatically calculated based on
the information you enter in section B. The minimum expected amount of money to sponsor is
indicated in the Sponsorship Cost Table (Appendix A).
ii. Estimated living costs in the expected community of settlement
In this section you will create a budget based on annual estimated settlement costs for the
refugees. The budget includes:
start-up costs (items purchased once to help the refugees become established)
on-going monthly costs (including rent, food, phone and internet, pocket money and
allowances and transportation costs)
For one-time start-up costs, enter the estimated amount for each item.
For ongoing monthly costs, enter the estimated monthly cost. The annual cost column and total
annual living costs fields will be automatically calculated.
The total annual living costs you budget for must be greater than or equal
to the minimum financial requirement in section E (i).
iii. Donations
In this section, you can deduct costs for items you are donating.
Use the In-kind Deduction Table in Appendix A.
Enter the in-kind deduction amount for each donated item.
Pay attention to the maximum allowable deductions for each item.
If the amount you enter is more than the maximum allowable deduction for the family
size, you will get an error message and that amount will be deleted.
Enter shelter donations amount, only if donor is party to the sponsorship undertaking
Options for providing in-kind shelter:
Shelter may be donated fully in-kind as long as it is safe, secure and suitable for the size
of the family unit, and provided to the refugee(s) without cost.
In-kind shelter can be provided by anyone other than a refugee that is within their
sponsorship period.
Sponsors have the following options for demonstrating in-kind shelter:
If housing is being donated by a member of the sponsorship group included as a
signatory to the sponsorship undertaking:
The sponsoring group does not need to demonstrate that funds are in place to
provide housing and may enter the full in-kind shelter amount in this section of
the form.
If housing is being donated by someone that isn’t a member of the sponsoring
group, chose one of the following options:
Add the donor as a party to the sponsorship; or
Demonstrate in the proof of funds that 100% of the minimum required shelter
amount per Sponsorship Cost tables (see Appendix A) is
in place to provide housing in case the third party support becomes unavailable.
While shelter may still be provided fully in-kind post-arrival, the sponsor must
demonstrate that funds are available at the application-stage as a contingency
measure.
iv. Financial Requirement
This section will automatically calculate your total financial requirement for
sponsorship by subtracting the in-kind deductions from the estimated annual living
costs.
If your estimated annual living costs are less than the minimum financial requirement in
section E (i), the minimum financial requirement will be used for the calculation
instead.
v. Total Committed Funds
In this section, your group must enter the amount of money each group member is committing
and/or the funds held in trust your group is providing towards the sponsorship. If you are
contributing personal income, enter the amount.
If you are contributing funds in trust, you must explain how they were obtained
and submit proof. If that is not provided, your application may be refused.
vi. Assessment of Financial Capacity
This section will indicate if your group has enough funds to sponsor. The form will
automatically subtract the Financial Requirement in section E (iv) from the Committed Funds
in section E (v).
If your group has committed enough funds:
the balance will be positive and a checkmark will appear
If your group has not committed enough funds:
the balance will be negative and an X will appear
The sponsorship application will be refused if the group has not committed sufficient funds.
Section F – Obligations, Consent and Declarations
This section must be read carefully and understood by all parties to the sponsorship.
Section G – Signatures
Each sponsor must sign and date the application.
By signing here, each member of the sponsoring group declares that they understand and
commit to upholding the terms outlined on the Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement
Plan, in accordance with the Post-arrival
Support Requirements for Private Sponsorships.
If a signature is missing or if it is dated more than 90 days prior to the date of
submission at ROC-O, the application may be returned.
As the sponsors, you must ensure that all the information contained in the application is
accurate at the time of submission at ROC-O.

Financial
Evaluation for Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship [IMM 5768] is
the form that IRCC uses to assess the total number of people you must account for when
determining the income that you must have in order to sponsor. IRCC will use the
calculation that you enter into Box 7 of IMM 5768 as a starting point when calculating
your family size.
However, this calculation is not determinative and IRCC will also confirm the calculation
in light of the detailed family information in your application. The number you enter
into Box 7 only captures your current family size, and does not necessarily reflect the
size of your family during the 3 tax years before your application date, which is
relevant for the calculation of your income requirements. If your family size changed
during or since those 3 years, it could affect the amount of income you need for each of
the 3 years. IRCC may also calculate a different family size for specific years based on
the detailed family information you provide in your sponsorship application.

IRCC consent to collect your SIN to ask for your income tax information from the CRA for

grandparent(s).
