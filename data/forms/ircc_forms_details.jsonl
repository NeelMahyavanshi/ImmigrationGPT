You will still have the right to vote in federal elections and referendums, but you will have to take the necessary steps to be added to the list.\nMore information about the Register and its uses is available on their website. You can also call Elections Canada at 1-800-463-6868.\nChief Electoral officer of Québec, if you live in Québec\nIf you are 18 years or older and reside in Québec, indicate whether you authorize IRCC to provide to the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec the following information so that your name can be added to the Permanent List of Electors (voters) if you became a Canadian citizen:\nyour name\nyour residential address, and the date when you started to reside at that address\nyour gender\nyour date of birth\nyour Unique Client Identifier (UCI), and\nthe date you were granted citizenship\nYour application for citizenship will in no way be affected by your answer to this question.\nThe Election Act allows the Chief Electoral Officer of Québec to:\nprovide voter information to provincial political parties and members of the National Assembly as well as municipal and school boards to compile and update lists of electors (voters) lists for municipal and school elections, and\nnotify the elector in writing that their name has been entered on the permanent list of electors, requesting that the elector correct or complete the information which concerns them, where required.\nThe Chief Electoral Officer of Québec receives the UCI for administrative purposes only, while the date your citizenship was granted allows them to validate that you qualify as an elector based on the electoral laws it administers. This information is subject to no other use or communication.\nIf you do not provide authorization, you will still be able to vote, but you will have to visit the revision office and present two supporting documents to register.

If the minor applies\nbefore they meet the physical presence requirements, they will not qualify for\ncitizenship. The application will be returned and the minor will have to\nre-apply later.\nYou must complete and submit the printout of your Online Physical Presence\nCalculation.

You are required to submit sufficient information and\nevidence to demonstrate that you have sufficient financial means to support the principal\napplicant and their family members.\nWhat is your family size? (for option A or C only)\nFamily size for financial capacity calculation includes:\nYou (the anchor)\nYour spouse or common-law\npartner (even if they are not living with you)\nYour dependent\nchildren (even if they are not living with you)\nTheir dependent children, if they have any\nYour spouse’s or common-law partner’s dependent children , and\nTheir dependent children, if they have any\nThe principal applicant (foreign national)\nThe principal applicant’s spouse or common-law partner (if accompanying the principal\napplicant to Canada)\nThe dependent children of the principal applicant and principal applicant’s spouse or\ncommon-law partner (if accompanying the principal applicant to Canada)\nThe dependent children of the dependent children, if they have any and if accompanying the\nprincipal applicant to Canada\nAny other person that you and your co-signer (if you have one) sponsored or co-signed, whom\nthey’re still financially responsible for (for example, sponsored refugees) and their\nfamily members\nAny other person for whom you (and/or the co-anchor, if you have one) have submitted a\nstatutory declaration to support them under this public policy, not listed in this statutory\ndeclaration. If you are submitting multiple applications, you must include in your family\nsize all foreign nationals (principal applicants) and their accompanying family members for\nwhom you have submitted a statutory declaration under this public policy.\nThe information provided in the family size\ncalculation will be compared to the information contained in IRCC’s database.\nExamples:\nFor option A:\nAnchor + spouse (married with a sponsorship application in progress) = 2\nPrincipal applicant #1 (single , no children) = 1\nPrincipal applicant #2 + spouse + 3 children = 5\nTotal family size : 8. The minimum necessary income needed is $85,666\nFor option B:\nPrincipal applicant #1 + spouse = 2  persons  funds needed $14,950\nPrincipal applicant #2 (single, no children) = 1 persons funds needed $9,900 Totals funds needed : $14,950 + $9,900 = $24,850\nFor Option C:\nAnchor + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)\nPrincipal applicant #1 + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)\nPrincipal applicant #2 + spouse (2 people)\nTotal family size = 10 persons The minimum necessary income is $101,498\nIf your income is $55,000 you need $46,498 of available funds (Total minimum necessary income - your income).\nHow much income and/or funds are available?\nIn order to act as an anchor, you must meet the financial requirement of one of the three options\ndescribed below.\nOption A - Minimum necessary Income (MNI)\nRefer to the low income cut-off table (Table 1) and the amount required\naccording to the number of people you entered in the family size calculation above. This is the\namount of income you must have to act as an anchor.\nYou can still act as an anchor if you are receiving maternity, parental and sickness benefits\npaid under the Employment Insurance Act. These benefits also count as income for the\npurposes of meeting the Minimum necessary income.\nThe income requirement is based on Statistics Canada’s annual Low-income Cut-Off (LICO).\nFederal Income Table, 2024\nTable 1 - Low Income Cut-Off (LICO)\nFamily size as calculated above\nMinimum necessary income ($)\n1 person (the sponsor)\n$29,380\n2 persons\n$36,576\n3 persons\n$44,966\n4 persons\n$54,594\n5 persons\n$61,920\n6 persons\n$69,834\n7 persons\n$77,750\nMore than 7 persons, for each additional person, add\n$7,916\nOption B - Minimum necessary funds\nThe minimum necessary funds is an amount held in an in-trust account at a\nCanadian financial institution. The funds must be accessible to the foreign national once\ngranted permanent residence in Canada. The total number of persons is equal in number to the\nforeign national (principal applicant) and their accompanying family members.\nTable 2 – Minimum necessary funds\nTotal number of persons\nTotal funds required ($)\n1\n9,900\n2\n14,950\n3\n16,500\n4\n18,100\n5\n20,450\n6\n22,650\n7 or more (for each additional member)\n1,900\nOption C – Combination of income and funds\nIf you do not meet the minimum necessary income requirements described in Option A or the minimum\nnecessary funds under Option B, you can use a combination of income and funds to meet financial\nrequirement.\nTo determine if you meet the requirement for Option C, you must use this formula:\nExample 1:\nThe minimum necessary income (MNI) required for a family size of 7 is $77,750.\nYour income is $60,000 + funds in your in-trust account is $20,000 = $80,000.\nAs the combination of income and funds is higher than MNI of $77, 750, you would be financially eligible to act as an Anchor.\nExample 2:\nIf you are acting as an anchor for more than one application you must have separate in-trust\naccounts for each principal applicant.\nFor example:\nAnchor + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)\nSibling A + spouse + 2 dependent children (4 people)\nSibling B + spouse (2 people)\nTotal = 10 persons\nIn this scenario, Sibling A and Sibling B are both principal applicants with their own statutory\ndeclarations and must each have a separate in-trust account.\nThe minimum necessary income to support 10 people (Sibling A + Sibling B + Anchor and all dependents) = $101,498\nIf your income is $55,000 you need $46,498 of available funds (totally funds necessary- your income).\nDivide the available funds necessary into trust accounts for Sibling A and Sibling B based on\ntheir family size.\n$46,498 divided by 6 persons (Sibling A + Sibling B+ their dependents)= $7,749 per person\nTrust Account for Sibling A (4 persons x $7,749) available funds = $30,998\nTrust Account for Sibling B (2 persons x $7,749) available funds = $15,499\nFunds held in an in-trust account\nThe funds must remain in the account until the principal applicant arrives and must be deposited\nto an account held at a Canadian financial institution in Canadian currency.\nThis account does not need to be a formal trust account.\nThis account can be an informal in-trust chequing or savings account.\nSection K – Declaration of extended family member (Anchor\nand co-anchor, if applicable)\nRead all of the statements in all sections carefully.\nWrite your complete name and the name of the foreign national identified in section B.\nCheck the box to tell us the relationship between yourself and the foreign national. If you check\n“other” you must specify.\nSign and date in the spaces provided. By signing, you certify that you fully understand the\nquestions asked, and that the information you have provided is complete, truthful, and correct.\nBy signing, you certify that you will support the person identified in Section B and their accompanying family members for a period of one year.\nIf you do not sign and date this form, it will not be accepted to support an application under this public policy, and as a result, the application will be considered incomplete and will be returned to the applicant.\nReminder: The foreign national MUST be one of the following person to you:\nYour child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or sibling\nThe spouse or common-law partner of the foreign national indicated in A, who is missing, presumed dead or deceased\nSection L - Declaration of Canadian Authorized official\nYou must complete and sign this form by solemn declaration in the presence of a Canadian\nAuthorized official who, by law, is authorized to receive a solemn declaration.\nThis can be done in person or remotely.\nIn Canada, this person must be:\na notary\npublic;\na commissioner\nof oaths; or\na commissioner\nof taking affidavits.\nAuthority to certify varies by province and territory.

You can view (and print) your tax return(s) as well as other personal tax\ninformation using the CRA’s My Account online service. To register or login, visit My Account. Your spouse or common-law partner\nwill also have to obtain a Notice of Assessment if he or she is co-signing the undertaking.\nIf you are unable to obtain and produce a Notice of Assessment or if your income reported in this\ndocument is less than your minimum necessary income, you will need to provide documentation\nestablishing the amount of income you earned over the period of 12 months preceding the date of\nyour application, such as: pay stubs, if you are employed; a statement of business of\nactivities, if you are self-employed; bank statements, if you have received interest income;\nstatements or certificates, if you have other sources of income (investment, rental, pension,\nspecial benefits paid under the Employment Insurance Act, etc.).

Income from other personal\nself-employment endeavours such as farming, fishing, commission sales,\nconsulting and child care that are conducted for profit should also be included.\nBe careful to indicate clearly the reference period (first line at the beginning of each section\nyou complete). For example, if the date of your application was June 5, 2004, and you were\nself-employed during the 12 months preceding your application, you would complete section C in\nthe Period I column, providing on the first line of that section the start (June 6, 2003) and\nthe end (June 5, 2004) of the 12-month period. However, if you had been working for an employer\nfor only six months, were self-employed for the two months before you were hired and, before\nthat, were unemployed, you would first complete section B in the Period I column, indicating\nyour employment information and, on the first line of that section, the date you were hired\n(December 1, 2003 for the purpose of our example) and the date of your application (June 5,\n2004).

This estimate is based on the\nSponsorship Cost Table, which is an average of all the provincial/territorial social assistance\nrates in Canada.\nThe form will automatically populate the cost table amount based on the number of family members\nyou enter in Section B, but you are encouraged to refer to Appendix A for\nmore information on how to calculate your cost estimate, including maximum in-kind deduction\namounts.\nDepending on where you live, this cost estimate may be higher or lower than the\nactual amount of money you need to provide to the refugees after they arrive in\nCanada. This actual amount of money is based on the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) rates\nand policies in the community where the refugee will live.\nPlease see the Post-arrival\nSupport Requirements for Private Sponsorships for information on the actual amount of\nmoney you will need to provide after the refugees arrive in Canada.\nPlease contact the Refugee Sponsorship Training\nProgram (RSTP) for information on the actual amount of money you will need to provide\nafter the refugees arrive in Canada.\nI.

For reference purposes, the minimum expected amount of money\nto sponsor is indicated in the Sponsorship Cost Table (Appendix A).\nII. In-kind Deductions\nIn this section, you can deduct costs for items you are donating.\nUse the In-kind Deduction Table in Appendix A.\nEnter the in-kind deduction amount for each donated item.\nPay attention to the maximum allowable deductions for each item.\nIf the amount you enter is more than the maximum allowable deduction for the family size,\nyou will get an error message and that amount will be deleted.\nEnter shelter donations amount only if the donor is party to the sponsorship undertaking\n(See the following section on options for providing in-kind shelter).\nOptions for providing in-kind shelter:\nShelter may be donated fully in-kind as long as it is safe, secure and suitable for the size of\nthe family unit, and provided to the refugee(s) without cost.\nIn-kind shelter can be provided by anyone other than a refugee that is within their sponsorship\nperiod.\nSponsors have the following options for demonstrating in-kind shelter:\nIf housing is being donated by a member of the sponsorship group included as a\nsignatory to the sponsorship undertaking:\nThe sponsoring group does not need to demonstrate that funds are in place to provide\nhousing and may enter the full in-kind shelter amount in this section of the form.\nIf housing is being donated by someone that isn’t a member of the sponsoring group,\nchose one of the following options:\nAdd the donor as a party to the sponsorship; or\nSubmit a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the third party and the SAH\ndetailing agreed upon housing arrangements; or\nDemonstrate in the proof of funds that 100% of the minimum required shelter amount\nper Sponsorship Cost tables (see Appendix A) is in place to\nprovide housing in case the third party support becomes unavailable. While shelter\nmay still be provided fully in-kind post-arrival, the sponsor must demonstrate that\nfunds are available at the application-stage as a contingency measure.\nIII. Total Financial Requirement\nThis section will automatically calculate your total financial requirement for sponsorship\nby subtracting the in-kind deductions (I) from the minimum financial requirement (II).\nIV. Total Committed Funds\nIn this section, you must enter:\nThe funds held in trust; and/or\nthe amount of money each individual co-sponsor is committing to the sponsorship, if\napplicable.

Assessment of Financial Capacity\nThis section will indicate if your group has enough funds to sponsor. The form will automatically\nsubtract the Total Financial Requirement in section III from the Total Committed Funds in\nsection IV.\nIf your group has committed enough funds:\nthe balance will be positive\nIf your group has not committed enough funds:\nthe balance will be negative\nThe sponsorship application will be refused if the group has not committed enough\nfunds.\nSection E - Signatures\nEach sponsor must sign and date the application\nBy signing here, each member of the sponsoring group declares that they understand\nand commit to upholding the terms outlined on the Sponsorship Undertaking (all SAH\nplans) and Settlement Plan (Plans B and C only), in accordance with the Post-Arrival\nSupport Requirements for Private Sponsorships.\nIf a signature is missing or if it is dated more than 90 days prior to the date of\nsubmission at ROC-O, the application will be returned to you without being\nprocessed.\nAs the sponsors, you must ensure that all the information contained in the application is\naccurate at the time of submission at ROC-O\nIf there are changes to your sponsoring group’s composition or changes to your PA’s family\ncomposition at any stage in processing, a new Sponsorship Undertaking must be submitted.\nSee options for signing the sponsorship forms."}

Where practicable, the\nplanned arrangements should be in place before the refugee arrives.\nIn those instances where refugee applicants intend to live together in Canada as a family\nunit but are named on separate Undertakings only one Settlement Plan encompassing the entire\nhousehold is required. It must, however, reflect the resettlement needs of each individual\nbeing sponsored.\nSubmission of Settlement Plan\nSponsorship Agreement Holders must complete a Settlement Plan for each JAS undertaking they sign but are\nnot required to submit the form to the ROC-O (note exception below).\nConstituent Groups must also complete a Settlement Plan for each JAS undertaking they sign and must\nsubmit it to their Sponsorship Agreement Holder. The SAH assesses the overall application and,\nwhen satisfied, issues a letter of approval authorizing the group to sponsor under their\nagreement. Both the SAH and the\nConstituent Group are required to retain a copy of the Settlement Plan in their files.\nNote: Exception – Sponsorship Agreement Holders (and their respective\nConstituent Groups) that signed an agreement with the Minister less than two years ago\nare required to submit the Settlement Plan to the Resettlement Operations\nCentre – Ottawa (ROC-O) as part of the sponsorship application.\nSection A – General information\nWrite the complete name of the:\nprincipal refugee applicant\nSponsorship Agreement Holder\nConstituent Group (if applicable)\nContact person\nWrite the details of your contact person (complete address, telephone, fax and e-mail,\nmailing address complete with the postal code).\nSection B – Settlement Needs – Checklist\nCheck the box to indicate that you acknowledge that your sponsoring group is aware of all\nrefugees’ settlement needs and will be providing the necessary settlement assistance for\nthem.\nIdentify who will be providing for the settlement needs of the refugee(s) by checking the\nrelevant box.\nWhere more than one party is providing for a particular need, check all boxes that apply.\nSection C – Settlement Needs – Details\nAnswer each question in a detailed yet concise manner.\nNote: Joint Assistance Sponsorship cases will receive orientation and\nincome support through the Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP).\nThis assistance will be provided by the service providers in partnership with sponsoring\ngroups.\nQuestion 1\nIf temporarily staying with relatives, provide information on family composition of\nthe family relatives that the sponsored refugee(s) will be staying with and what\ncurrent accommodation arrangements the relatives have. Also, provide details on the\ntime frame when you anticipate that permanent accommodation will be found and what\ntype of accommodation you are looking for e.g.\nhouse or apartment.\nQuestion 2\nIndicate the names of the individuals that will be volunteering and what tasks they\nwill be assisting with e.g. arrival, Social\nInsurance Number (S.I.N.) application, Health card application, medical\nappointments, etc.\nQuestion 3a\nUpon indicating the settlement agency, indicate what service(s) the refugee(s) will\nbe obtaining from that agency e.g. Language\ntraining, translation of documents, etc.\nQuestion 3b\nIf you have not contacted any agencies to provide settlement support, indicate when\nyou plan on making this contact. If you have contacted some agencies, indicate the\ndate, the name of the person you made contact with and in regards to what services.\nAlso, indicate if you have dealt with these agencies in the past and what type of\nservices your sponsored refugees have accessed from them.\nQuestion 4\nSome contingency plans can include scenarios such as the refugee(s) was or were\noriginally supposed to reside with a relative in Canada upon arrival; however, they\nchoose to reside on their own for the duration of the sponsorship period. Provide\nsome details as to how you will provide support for the additional costs that will\noccur. Another scenario could be that the refugee(s) choose to move to a different\ncity.
